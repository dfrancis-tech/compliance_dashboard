# Monitoring Fairness and Bias in Machine Learning Models
This project focuses on creating a web-based dashboard to monitor the fairness and bias of machine learning models. 
The key components include an HTML template (dashboard.html) and a Flask app (app.py) that work together to display interactive charts illustrating fairness and bias metrics for different model outcomes. The project showcases the integration of Flask, Plotly, and HTML templates to create a dynamic dashboard for monitoring the fairness and bias of machine learning models. It provides a user-friendly interface for evaluating and understanding the ethical implications of model predictions.

# Accessing the Dashboard
After running the Flask app using python app.py, the dashboard becomes accessible through a web browser by navigating to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. The dashboard's webpage displays the specified title, followed by interactive fairness and bias charts. These charts provide visual insights into the fairness and bias of the simulated machine learning models' outcomes, based on the mock data from mock_data.csv.
