    "The line if __name__ == '__main__': is a common construct in Python that is used to check whether a Python script is being run directly or if it's being imported as a module into another script.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Python script, the Python interpreter sets a special built-in variable called __name__ to \"__main__\" for the script that is being executed. On the other hand, if the script is imported as a module into another script, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the script (module) itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "Running a Script Directly:\n",
    "When you run a Python script directly from the command line or an IDE, the __name__ variable of that script is set to \"__main__\". This allows you to include specific code that should only be executed when the script is run directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing a Script as a Module:\n",
    "If you import a Python script as a module into another script or interactive session, the __name__ variable of the imported script will be set to its filename (without the .py extension) instead of \"__main__\". This allows you to create reusable modules that can be imported and used in different scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the conditional block if __name__ == '__main__': allows you to include code that should only be executed when the script is run directly. This is often used for testing, debugging, or performing specific tasks that are relevant only when the script is executed on its own."
